Personal HTML resume built with hybrid font-end little tricks ðŸ’©

### Todo List
- [x] use npm as default package manager
- [x] use bower to install front-end dependencies
- [x] use jekyll to generate the static site (folder structure convention)
- [ ] use webpack as default module bundler if necessary
- [ ] use lightweight only js framework for scale if necessary
- [ ] make it cross device / platform
